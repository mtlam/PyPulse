Scripts
=====================

There are a number of command-line scripts that come with PyPulse for convenience. More to come!




fitsheader_to_txt
-----------------

Prints out the PSRFITS file header information

fits_to_npy
-----------

Converts the data within a PSRFITS file into a .npy file. No metadata are stored with the file.


pypav
-----

Like PSRCHIVE's `pav` routine, this will provide plots of a PSRFITS file.


partytricks
-----------

This will take a Par file and calculate the number of pulses from a given time. It can also calculate the eccentricity errors if available
